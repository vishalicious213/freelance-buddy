    <h1>The Contract</h1>
    <h4>Between <span id="company-name">[company name]</span></h4>
    <h4>And <span id="customer-name">[customer name]</span></h4>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I will always do my best to fulfill your needs and meet your expectations, but it’s important to have things written down so that we both know what’s what, who should do what and when, and what will happen if something goes wrong.</p>
    <p>In this contract you won’t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. I would never want to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. What I do want is what’s best for both parties, now and in the future.</p>
    <p>In short:</p>
    <p>You ([customer name]), located at [customer address] (“You”) are hiring me ([company name]) (“Me”) to:</p>
    <p>[Design and develop a web site]</p>
    <p>For the estimated total price of [total] as outlined in our previous correspondence.</p>

    <h2>What do both parties agree to?</h2>
    <p><b>You</b>: You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or your organization. You will give me the assets and information that I tell you I need to complete the project. You’ll do this when I ask and provide it in the formats I ask for. You’ll review my work, provide feedback and approval in a timely manner too. We will both be bound by dates we set together. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out at the end of this contract.</p>
    <p><b>Me</b>: I have the experience and ability to do everything I’ve discussed with you and I will do it all in a professional and timely manner. I will do my best to meet every deadline that’s set, and I will maintain the confidentiality of everything you give me.</p>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>I create designs that adapt to the capabilities of many devices and screen sizes. I create them iteratively using HTML and CSS, and it would be a poor use of my time to mock up every template as a static visual. I may use visuals to indicate a creative direction (color, texture and typography).</p>
    <p>You will have plenty of opportunities to review my work and provide feedback. I will share a Github repository and development site with you and we will have regular contact via phone, email, or any video chat provider we agree to, such as Zoom or Skype.</p>
    <p>If — at any stage — you change your mind about what you want delivered or aren’t happy with the direction my work is taking, you will pay me in full for the time I've spent working until that point and may terminate this contract.</p>

    <h2>Text content</h2>
    <p>Unless agreed separately, I am not responsible for inputting text or images into your content management system or creating every page on your website. I do provide professional copywriting and editing services, so if you’d like me to create new content or input content for you, I will provide a separate estimate.</p>

    <h2>Graphics and photographs</h2>
    <p>You should supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital format. You should supply photographs in a high resolution digital format. If you choose to buy stock photographs, I can suggest stock libraries. If you’d like me to search for photographs for you, I can provide a separate estimate.</p>

    <h2>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h2>
    <p>I deliver pages developed from HTML markup, CSS stylesheets for styling and JavaScript for behavior.</p>

    <h2>Browser testing</h2>
    <p>Browser testing no longer means attempting to make a website look the same in browsers of different capabilities or on devices with different size screens. It does mean ensuring that a person’s experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.</p>
    <p>I test my work in current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Edge), and Mozilla Firefox. I will not test in other older browsers unless we agreed separately. If you need an enhanced design for an older browser, I can provide a separate estimate for that.</p>

    <h2>Mobile browser testing</h2>
    <p>Testing using popular smaller screen devices is essential in ensuring that a person’s experience of a design is appropriate to the capabilities of the device they’re using. I test my designs in:</p>
    <p>iOS: Safari and Google Chrome</p>
    <p>Android: Google Chrome</p>
    <p>I will not test in Opera Mini/Mobile, specific Android devices, or other mobile browsers.</p>

    <h2>Technical support</h2>
    <p>I am not a website hosting company so I do not offer support for website hosting, email or other services relating to hosting. You may already have professional hosting. If you don’t, I will recommend one of my preferred hosting providers. I can set up your site on a server if you'd like, and will provide a separate estimate for that. Then, the updates to, and management of that server will be up to you.</p>
    <p>For most projects, I prefer a serverless solution to save us both time and money. This means your website is hosted in the cloud and so there is no need for server management. I will recommend this option when I feel it is appropriate.</p>

    <h2>Search engine optimization (SEO)</h2>
    <p>I do not guarantee improvements to your website’s search engine ranking, but the pages that I develop are accessible to search engines. I do offer search engine optimization services, and can provide a separate estimate for that.</p>

    <h2>Chanes and revisions</h2>
    <p>I do not want to limit your ability to change your mind. The price at the beginning of this contract is based on the amount of time that I estimate I'll need to accomplish everything you’ve told me you want to achieve, but I'm happy to be flexible. If you want to change your mind or add anything new, that won’t be a problem as I will provide a separate estimate for the additional time.</p>
