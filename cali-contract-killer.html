    <h1>The Contract</h1>
    <h4>Between <span id="company-name">[company name]</span></h4>
    <h4>And <span id="customer-name">[customer name]</span></h4>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I will always do my best to fulfill your needs and meet your expectations, but it’s important to have things written down so that we both know what’s what, who should do what and when, and what will happen if something goes wrong.</p>
    <p>In this contract you won’t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. I would never want to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. What I do want is what’s best for both parties, now and in the future.</p>
    <p>In short:</p>
    <p>You ([customer name]), located at [customer address] (“You”) are hiring me ([company name]) (“Me”) to:</p>
    <p>[Design and develop a web site]</p>
    <p>For the estimated total price of [total] as outlined in our previous correspondence.</p>

    <h2>What do both parties agree to?</h2>
    <p><b>You</b>: You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or your organization. You will give me the assets and information that I tell you I need to complete the project. You’ll do this when I ask and provide it in the formats I ask for. You’ll review my work, provide feedback and approval in a timely manner too. We will both be bound by dates we set together. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out at the end of this contract.</p>
    <p><b>Me</b>: I have the experience and ability to do everything I’ve discussed with you and I will do it all in a professional and timely manner. I will do my best to meet every deadline that’s set, and I will maintain the confidentiality of everything you give me.</p>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>I create designs that adapt to the capabilities of many devices and screen sizes. I create them iteratively using HTML and CSS, and it would be a poor use of my time to mock up every template as a static visual. I may use visuals to indicate a creative direction (color, texture and typography).</p>
    <p>You will have plenty of opportunities to review my work and provide feedback. I will share a Github repository and development site with you and we will have regular contact via phone, email, or any video chat provider we agree to, such as Zoom or Skype.</p>
    <p>If — at any stage — you change your mind about what you want delivered or aren’t happy with the direction my work is taking, you will pay me in full for the time I've spent working until that point and may terminate this contract.</p>
