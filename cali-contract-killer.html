    <h4>And <span id="customer-name">[customer name]</span></h4>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I will always do my best to fulfill your needs and meet your expectations, but it’s important to have things written down so that we both know what’s what, who should do what and when, and what will happen if something goes wrong.</p>
    <p>In this contract you won’t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. I would never want to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. What I do want is what’s best for both parties, now and in the future.</p>
    <p>In short:</p>
    <p>You ([customer name]), located at [customer address] (“You”) are hiring me ([company name]) (“Me”) to:</p>
    <p>[Design and develop a web site]</p>
    <p>For the estimated total price of [total] as outlined in our previous correspondence.</p>
